-- Developed a full-stack Todo application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with secure user authentication. The app allows users to register, log in, and manage personal tasks with full CRUD functionality. Implemented JWT for token-based authentication and bcrypt for password hashing to ensure data security. The frontend was built with React.js, featuring responsive design, dynamic rendering, and API integration. On the backend, RESTful APIs were created with Express.js and Node.js, and MongoDB was used for data persistence with Mongoose for schema modeling. The project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, secure authentication, and deployment of modern web applications.
